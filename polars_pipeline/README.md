# polars pipeline

`polars` utilizes all available cores on a single machine with its query optimization and column-oriented data storage, making it a nice option (in terms of accessibility and speed) for a non-distribution setup.

### Instruction
At the time of writing, `polars` is undergoing rapid development with frequent new releases. Some functions might change in future releases, so it is important to install only the version (`0.18.1`) that the pipeline uses to avoid any bugs.


To run this, please refer to the polar section on `cli_examples.sh`
