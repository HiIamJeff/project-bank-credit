# polars pipeline

`polars` utilizes all available cores on a single machine with its query optmization and column-oriented data storage, making it a nice option (in terms of accessibility and speed) for a non-distribution setup.

### Instruction
Please install `polars` (version `0.18.1`) following [the official guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/installation/) (`requirements.txt` doesn't cover the package). 
> p.s. At the time of writing, `polars` is undergoing rapid development with frequent new releases. Some functions might change in the future releases, so it is important to install the version that the pipeline uses to avoid any bugs.


To run this, please refer to the polar section on `cli_examples.sh`
